## Projects
**Food Inventory App**: A web application for managing and organizing food items. The application also has support for user profiles, email updates, user posts, and CRUD functionality.

Technologies used: Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Description: I built this application to help myself and others keep track of food items and expiration in a simple and efficient manner. It includes features such as a barcode API for finding food items to add and a MySQL database that can be edited, email reminders that can be opted into or out of, and categorizing food items by expiration.

**Photography Portfolio**: A personal photography portfolio

Technologies used: Python, Django, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Description: This is a personal photography portfolio to display some of my work and get into contact with me. The gallery page can be sorted by the categories listed on the left. This allows potential clients the ability to filter for the work they like most. The gallery has pagination at the bottom to keep users from being too overwhelmed by the many options in front of them. Each photo is hosted by AWS buckets, which is extremely scalable.

**RichmondYorkies**: A yorkie breeding website

Technologies used: Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Description: A Python Django website for a party yorkie breeding business where customers can find information about the breed, available puppies, and make reservations to adopt a parti yorkie. The website also includes a section for the breeder to post updates and information about their breeding practices and any upcoming litters.
